# Middleware directory

Nuxt provides a customizable middleware framework you can use throughout your application, ideal for extracting code that you want to run before navigating to a particular route.

::alert{type=info}
Nuxt middleware run within the Vue part of your Nuxt app. Despite the name, they are completely different from server middleware, which are run in the Nitro server part of your app.
::

There are two kinds of middleware:

1. Anonymous (or inline) middleware, which are defined directly in the pages where they are used.
2. Named middleware, which are placed in the `middleware/` directory and will be automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used on a page.

Both kinds of middleware can be [defined in `definePageMeta`](/docs/directory-structure/pages).

## Format

Nuxt middleware are navigation guards that receive the current route and the next route as arguments, as well as a third argument that _must_ be called.

```js
export default defineNuxtMiddleware((to, from, next) => {
  // ...
  next()
})
```

For more on this format, and the effect of passing an argument to `next()`, see [the vue-router docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-before-guards). In brief:

* `next()` - moves to the next middleware function, if any
* `next(false)` - stops the current navigation
* `next('/')` or `next({ path: '/' })` - redirects to the given path
* `next(error)` - rejects the current navigation with an error

## Example: a named middleware

```bash
-| middleware/
---| auth.ts
```

In your page file, you can reference this middleware

```vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: ["auth"]
  // or middleware: 'auth'
})
</script>
```

Now, before navigation to that page can complete, the `auth` middleware will be run.
